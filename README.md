# Fitness Exercises App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The exercises,videos from youtube database is taken from the [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel) for exercises and [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/h0p3rwe/api/youtube-search-and-download?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel) for videos as endpoints.

# About project
The free API from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb?utm_source=youtube.com%2FJavaScriptMastery&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=DevRel) is used for data access.

I chose this project to learn new functionalities and more aspects, tips and tricks in React.js. In the project code I used the following hooks: useState, useEffect, useParams, useContext, useNavigate (React Router) and to work with Material UI. The data we receive it through Fetch we pass it through the created adapter, so we extract only the information that we still use in the project.

With the functionality to choose exercise categories and specific muscle groups, browse more than one thousand exercises with practical examples, pagination, exercise details, pull related videos from youtube, display similar exercises, and much more.
